//1. Arithmetic Operators: 
//Unary Operators
int val = 5;
++val;  // 6

//Binary Operators(*,/,-,+)
int a = 7;
int b = 2;
cout<<a+b; // 9

//2. Relational Operators
int a = 3;
int b = 5;
a < b; // operator to check if a is smaller than b

//3. Logical Operators
//AND = &&
//NOT equal to = !=

//4. Bitwise Operators
int a = 5, b = 9;   // a = 5(00000101), b = 9(00001001)
cout << (a ^ b);   //  00001100
cout <<(~a);       // 11111010

//5. Assignment Operators
//“=”
a = 10;
b = 20;
ch = 'y';

//“+=”
(a += b) can be written as (a = a + b)
//If initially value stored in a is 5. Then (a += 6) = 11.
  
//“-=”
(a -= b) can be written as (a = a - b)
//If initially value stored in a is 8. Then (a -= 6) = 2.  
//“*=”
(a *= b) can be written as (a = a * b)
//If initially, the value stored in a is 5. Then (a *= 6) = 30.  
//“/=”
(a /= b) can be written as (a = a / b)
// If initially, the value stored in a is 6. Then (a /= 2) = 3.
